	/*
	What is Multiple Inheritance?
	Multiple inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming where a class can
	 inherit properties and methods from more than one parent class.
	
	Implimention:
	class A {
	    void displayA() {
	        System.out.println("Class A");
	    }
	}

	class B {
	    void displayB() {
	        System.out.println("Class B");
	    }
	}

	// Multiple inheritance (not allowed in Java)
	class C extends A, B { // Not allowed
	    void displayC() {
	        System.out.println("Class C");
	    }
	}

	Why is Multiple Inheritance Not Supported Through Classes in Java?
	Java does not support multiple inheritance through classes to avoid ambiguity and 
	complexity, particularly in scenarios like the Diamond Problem.
